# Problem Statement
Email, due to its inexpensive nature and ease of use, is a popular method for
distributing fraudulent messages to potential victims. Approximately 90% of all
emails sent worldwide consist of spam, spoofed messages, or phishing attempts.
Some of the most common fraudulent messages are non-monetary hoaxes or
chain mail. You should treat these like any other spam messages â€“ put them in
your spam filter or simply delete.

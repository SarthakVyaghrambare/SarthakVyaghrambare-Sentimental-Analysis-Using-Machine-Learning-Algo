# Project Title
- Sentimental-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning-Algo
# Problem Statement
- Email, due to its inexpensive nature and ease of use, is a popular method for distributing fraudulent messages to potential victims.
- Approximately 90% of all emails sent worldwide consist of spam, spoofed messages, or phishing attempts.
- Some of the most common fraudulent messages are non-monetary hoaxes or chain mail.

# Dataset Used
- fraud_email_.csv
# What are the required python packages?
- pandas
- nltk
- string
- stopwords
- freqdist
- wordcloud
# Machine Learning Algorithm Used:-
- Logistic Regression
- Multiple Layer Perceptron
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
